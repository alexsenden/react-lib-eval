Create a ContactSupport component that allows users to request technical support. The layout should be as follows:

A Card component wraps the entire form.

Inside the card, show a title using a Text component: "Contact Support".

Below that, include an Input field labeled "Issue Title" and a TextArea for the issue description.

Below the TextArea, add a Select dropdown labeled "Priority" with options "Low", "Medium", and "High". The selected priority is stored in a variable named priority.

At the bottom, a Button labeled "Send Request" sets a variable submitted to true.

If submitted is true, display an Alert component with type "info" and content "Your support request has been submitted."
