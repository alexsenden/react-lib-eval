Create a ProfileSettings component where users can update their profile settings.

At the top, an Avatar shows the user's picture from "https://picsum.photos/100".

Below that, an Input for full name, and another Input for email address.

At the bottom, a Button labeled "Save Changes" triggers a Toast that says "Profile updated".
