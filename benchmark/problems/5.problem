Create a NotificationSystem component that handles different types of user notifications. The layout should be as follows:

At the top, an Alert component displays an urgent warning message ("System Maintenance in 1 hour").

Below the alert, a Button labeled "Show Notification" triggers a Modal component titled "Notification" containing detailed information.

This detailed information should read "The system will be down from 1AM to 8AM for maintenance.".

The modal is controlled with the "showModal" variable.

The modal should include a Spinner while loading content before displaying the full message. 

The code for the modal should be at the bottom of the component hierarchy.

The content is loading if the "loading" variable is true.

An informational Toast notification should appear at the bottom of the screen when a button to the right of the "Show Notification" button is clicked. This button should be labelled "Show Toast".

The toast should have the text "The system will resume regular operation at 8AM."

The toast should be controlled with a variable named "showToast".
