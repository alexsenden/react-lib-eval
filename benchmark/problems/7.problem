Create a FeedbackForm component that allows users to submit feedback about a service. The layout should be as follows:

At the top, display a title using the Text component that reads "We value your feedback!".

Below the title, include an Input field for the user's name.

Under the name input, include an Input field for the user's email.

Below the email input, provide a TextArea where users can describe their experience.

Beneath the TextArea, include a Checkbox labeled "Subscribe to our newsletter".

At the bottom of the form, include a Button labeled "Submit Feedback" that when clicked sets a variable named submitted to true.

If submitted is true, display a Toast component at the bottom of the component with the message: "Thank you for your feedback!"

The userâ€™s name should be stored in a variable called name, email in email, experience in experience, and the newsletter opt-in in subscribed.
