Create a FeedbackForm component that collects user feedback. The layout should be:

A Text component at the top labeled "Feedback".

Below, a TextArea for user input, and a Select for rating the experience with options "Poor", "Average", and "Excellent".

At the bottom, a Button labeled "Submit Feedback" that sets feedbackSubmitted to true.

If feedbackSubmitted is true, display an Alert with content "Feedback submitted successfully!".
