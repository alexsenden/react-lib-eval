Create a LanguageSelector component that lets users choose their language.

At the top, display a Text component that says "Select Language".

Below it, use a Select dropdown with options: English, Spanish, German, Japanese.

When the user selects a language, show a Toast that says "Language changed to [selected language]".

The selected language is stored in a variable called "language". The Toast visibility is controlled by "showToast".
