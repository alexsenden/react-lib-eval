Create a ThemeCustomizer component to let users tweak the UI theme.

Display inside a Card:

A Select to choose a theme: "Light", "Dark", "Solarized"

A Toggle to enable high-contrast mode

A Preview section (just a Text) that updates live

A Button to "Apply Settings" which opens a Modal with a Text: "Theme applied."

Use "theme", "highContrast", "fontSize", and "showModal" as state.
