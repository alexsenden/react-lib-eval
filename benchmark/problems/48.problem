Create a JobApplicationPortal component to simulate submitting a job application.

The layout should be:

A Text header: "Apply for a Position"

A Select for the job role, with options "Frontend Developer", "Backend Developer", and "UI/UX Designer"

When a role is selected, show an Input for full name

A TextArea for a cover letter

A Checkbox to agree to terms and conditions

A Button labeled "Submit Application" that opens a Modal if the checkbox is selected

The Modal should contain a single Spinner while submitting

After 2 seconds, the Modal should close and a Toast should display "Application submitted!"

Variables:

"selectedRole" (string)

"fullName" (string)

"coverLetter" (string)

"agreed" (boolean)

"showModal" (boolean)

"submitting" (boolean)
