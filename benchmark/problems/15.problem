Create a LanguageSelector component that allows the user to pick a language.

A Text component at the top says "Select Language".

Below that, a Select component with values "English", "Spanish", "German", "French".

Below the select, a Button labeled "Confirm" sets confirmed to true.

When confirmed is true, display a Toast that says "Language set to [language]".
