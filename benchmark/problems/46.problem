Create a UserOnboarding component with progressive steps.

At the top, show a ProgressBar (value depends on current step).

Steps:

Select a role: RadioButtons ("Developer", "Designer", "Manager")

Enter email: Input with placeholder

Agree to terms: Checkbox

Done: Show a Badge that says "Setup Complete" (type: success)

Use a Button labeled "Next" to go to the next step.

Track step with "step" (0â€“3), role with "role", email with "email", and agreement with "agreed".
