Create a NewsletterSignup component that allows users to subscribe to a newsletter. The layout should be as follows:

At the top, a Text component reads "Subscribe to our Newsletter".

Below that, an Input for email, and a Checkbox labeled "Receive weekly updates".

At the bottom, a Button labeled "Subscribe" triggers a variable subscribed to be set to true.

When subscribed is true, display a Toast with the message "Thank you for subscribing!".
