Create a QuizResultCard component to show a user’s quiz summary.

Inside a Card, show:

A Text titled "Your Results"

A ProgressBar showing score percentage

A Badge with type "success", "warning", or "error" based on the score range (score stored in "score")

A Text feedback message: "Great job!", "Almost there!", or "Try again."

A Button to "Review Answers" which opens a Modal with a Text: "Redirecting to review page..."

Score logic:

>= 80 → success

50–79 → warning

< 50 → error
