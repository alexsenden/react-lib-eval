Create a ProductComparison component that allows users to compare two products.

Each product has a Card with:

A Text title (e.g., "Product A", "Product B")

A Badge showing "Available" or "Out of Stock"

A List of features (e.g., "Waterproof", "Bluetooth", "1-year warranty")

Below both Cards, place a Button labeled "Show Comparison Summary" that opens a Modal titled "Comparison Summary" with a List of common features.

The modal is controlled by the "showSummary" variable.
