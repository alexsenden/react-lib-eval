Create a UserBadgeRow component that displays a list of users and their roles using Badge and Avatar components.

Each user should be shown in a horizontal flex layout with their Avatar on the left and their name and role Badge on the right.

Render three users:

Alice – Admin

Bob – Member

Charlie – Guest

Each Avatar should have a placeholder image ("https://picsum.photos/100") and the alt text should be the user's name.
