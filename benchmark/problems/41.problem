Create a FeedbackForm component where users can leave feedback on a recent experience.

At the top, a Select dropdown asks "How was your experience?" with options: Excellent, Good, Bad.

If the selected option is "Bad", show a TextArea asking "What went wrong?".

Below that, include a Checkbox labeled "Subscribe to updates about this issue".

Finally, a Button labeled "Submit" triggers a Toast that says "Thank you for your feedback."

The selected experience is stored in "experience".
The explanation is stored in "badFeedback".
The checkbox state is stored in "subscribed".
The toast visibility is stored in "showToast".
