Create a TermsAndConditions component that allows users to accept terms before proceeding.

At the top, a Checkbox labeled "I agree to the Terms and Conditions".

Below that, a Button labeled "Continue" that is only enabled if the checkbox is checked.

Clicking the button shows a Toast with the message "Thank you for agreeing to the terms.".

The checkbox value is stored in "agreed". The toast is controlled by "showToast".
