Create a SettingsPanel component that allows users to customize their preferences. The layout should be as follows:

A Checkbox at the top to enable or disable notifications.

Below it, a section labeled "Theme Selection" contains three RadioButton components allowing the user to choose between Light, Dark, and System themes.

Below the theme section is a section labelled "Preferred Language" with a Select dropdown allows the user to pick their preferred language from a list of English, Spanish, or French.

At the bottom is a final section labeled "Auto-Updates" with a Toggle switch that is used to enable or disable auto-updates. 

Each section should have a section title above it.
