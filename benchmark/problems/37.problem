Create a PasswordStrengthChecker component that lets users input a password and see its strength.

An Input field labeled "Password" should accept the password. Below it, display a ProgressBar representing strength.

The strength is calculated based on password length:

Less than 4: 0%

4â€“7: 50%

8 or more: 100%

The password is stored in a variable called "password". The progress value is stored in "strength".
