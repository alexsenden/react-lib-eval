Create a StatusUpdate component that allows a user to post a quick status message.

The layout should be as follows:

An Input labeled "Username" where the user types their username (stored in "username").

A TextArea labeled "What's on your mind?" where the user writes their status (stored in "status").

A Button labeled "Post" that triggers a function called "handlePost".
