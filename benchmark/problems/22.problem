Create a NewsletterSignup component that allows users to sign up for a newsletter.

The layout should be as follows:

An Input labeled "Email Address" where users can type their email (stored in the variable "email").

A Checkbox labeled "I agree to the terms and conditions" (state stored in "agree").

A Button labeled "Sign Up" that is disabled unless the checkbox is checked.
