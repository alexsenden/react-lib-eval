Create a WelcomeModal component that appears on page load and displays a welcome message and instructions.

The Modal should include:

A Text title ("Welcome!")

A Text body ("Use the navigation menu to explore features.")

A Button labeled "Got it" that closes the modal.

The modal is controlled by "showWelcome".
