Create a NewsletterSignup component that allows users to sign up for a newsletter. The layout should be as follows:

At the top, a Text component with the title "Subscribe to our Newsletter".

Below that, an Input field for the userâ€™s email address.

Next to the input field, a Button labeled "Sign Up" submits the form.

When the user clicks "Sign Up", a Toast should appear with the message "Thanks for subscribing!" if the email is not empty.

The email is stored in a variable named "email". The toast is controlled with a variable named "showToast".
