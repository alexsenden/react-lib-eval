Create a SettingsSummary component that shows different settings based on a Toggle.

At the top, a Toggle labeled "Advanced Mode".

If advanced mode is on, show a Card that includes:

A Text titled "Advanced Settings"

A Checkbox labeled "Enable experimental features"

A Spinner if the setting is loading (based on "loadingAdvanced")

If advanced mode is off, show a Card with a Text that says "Basic settings are enabled."

The toggle value is stored in "advanced".
The loading state is "loadingAdvanced".
The checkbox state is "experimental".
