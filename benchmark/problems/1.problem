Create a UserProfileCard component that displays a user's profile information. The layout should be as follows:

A Card component serves as the main container.

Inside the card, at the top left, an Avatar component displays the user's profile picture from the url "https://picsum.photos/150". The avatar's alt text should say "Avatar".

Next to the avatar, a Badge component displays the userâ€™s status ("Online" or "Offline").

Below the avatar and badge, display the user's name (John Doe) and a short bio ("Frontend Developer passionate about React.").

A Button component labeled "Follow" should be placed at the bottom of the card. Clicking it should toggle between "Follow" and "Unfollow".

A Link titled "View Profile" located below the button allows navigation to the full user profile at the "/profile" route.

The users online status should be stored in a variable called "isOnline".
The following status of the user should be stored in a variable called "following".
