Create a SupportPortal component that shows a list of support topics in an Accordion.

There should be 4 topics:

"Password Reset": "Go to settings and click 'Reset Password'."

"Billing Questions": "Email billing@example.com."

"Technical Issues": "Submit a ticket at /support/ticket."

"Account Deletion": "Visit /account/delete to begin the process."

At the bottom, a Link labeled "Contact Support" links to "/support/contact".
