Create a QuizSummary component that displays quiz results inside a Modal.

A Button labeled "View Summary" opens a Modal controlled by the variable "showSummary".

Inside the Modal:

A Text component showing the score, e.g., "You scored 8/10".

A ProgressBar showing percentage complete (80%).

A List of incorrectly answered questions (stored in "wrongAnswers").

At the bottom of the Modal, a Button labeled "Close".
