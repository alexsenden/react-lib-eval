Actually write it, but include these features:

Use div elements with the style prop's `display: flex` and `flexDirection` parameters to control layout
Do not use css or tailwind css
Only use library components or html components
Use as few components as necessary, and pass as few props as necessary.
Assume any necessary provider wrappers are already present higher in the component hierarchy (i.e. ThemeProvider, ToastProvider, etc.)
