Create an FAQAccordion component that displays frequently asked questions. The layout should be as follows:

An Accordion component which contains three FAQ items, where each question expands to reveal its answer when clicked.

The FAQ items are:

Question: "What programs are available at the University of Manitoba?"
Answer: "The University of Manitoba offers programs in Arts, Science, Engineering, Business, Medicine, and more."

Question: "What are the admission requirements at the University of Manitoba?"
Answer: "Requirements vary by program but usually include high school grades and English proficiency (IELTS/TOEFL for international students)."

Question: "How much is tuition at the University of Manitoba?"
Answer: "Domestic students pay lower fees, while international students typically pay $18,000â€“$26,000 per year."

At the bottom of the component, a Link labeled "View More FAQs" directs users to a full FAQ page at the route "/fullfaq".

The elements to be passed into the Accordion component should be put into an array and passed into the accordion using a variable named "items".
